        <details>heart, Organ that pumps blood, circulating it to all parts of the body
        (see circulation). The human heart is a four-chambered double pump with
        its right and left sides fully separated by a septum and subdivided on
        both sides into an atrium above and a ventricle below. The right atrium
        receives venous blood from the superior and inferior venae cavae (see
        vena cava) and propels it into the pulmonary circulation. The left
        atrium takes in blood from the pulmonary veins and sends it into the
        systemic circulation. Electrical signals from a natural pacemaker cause
        the heart muscle to contract. Valves in the heart keep blood flowing in
        one direction. Their snapping shut after each contraction causes the
        sounds heard as the heartbeat. See also cardiovascular system.
